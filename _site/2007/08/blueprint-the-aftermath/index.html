  <div class="content">
    <p>I&#8217;m tempted to ask you all if you can explain to me what just happened? I had no idea that this inconsequential experiment of a project could generate the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Visitors to the Blueprint site: <strong>54 548</strong></li>

<li>Downloads so far: <strong>6 118</strong></li>

<li><a href='http://del.icio.us/url/e6004c93e5c6469f7811306de6af3c52'>Del.icio.us</a> bookmarks: <strong>1 558</strong></li>

<li>Number of <a href='http://digg.com/design/Blueprint_A_CSS_Framework'>diggs</a>: <strong>1 217</strong></li>

<li>Average Digg comment opinion: <strong>Furiously offended</strong></li>

<li>Support requests curve: <strong>Exponential</strong></li>

<li>Giddiness level: <strong>Crimson red</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id='so_what_does_this_tell_us'>So what does this tell us?</h3>

<p>Blueprint is an unknown, untested and unused framework from an unknown guy launched from a highly irregular blog. This should make it quite clear that the craving for a proper designers framework almost couldn&#8217;t be greater.</p>

<p>As Blueprint is just a light breeze of a project, this gap in the market is a vacuum waiting to be filled. This sucks, as most vacuums do, so if anyone reading this is considering releasing their own framework or toolbox, please do so.</p>

<p>Just imagine what a project like BP on a greater scale can accomplish, if an experiment like this, with absolutely no merits or pre-launch hype, can gain this kind of traction.</p>

<h3 id='our_new_home'>Our new home</h3>

<p>As a result of this unexpected surge in traffic, I&#8217;ve moved the entire project to <a href='http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/'>Google Code</a>.</p>

<p>This is not just because they&#8217;ll host the BP download for free (my available gigabytes from MediaTemple were quickly disappearing though), but also because Google Code is a great place for almost any project.</p>

<p>With a wiki, issue tracking and SVN hosting, this new arrangement should make future development of BP a great experience for all of us.</p>

<p>(It&#8217;ll also be interesting to see if I can actually get someone to contribute their ideas and patches to this project. Does anyone want to create a logo? ;)</p>

<h3 id='feature_requests'>Feature requests</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve jotted down some of the most popular feature requests, which, with time, will hopefully make their way into BP:</p>

<ul>
<li>Relative font sizing everywhere</li>

<li>Multiple versions with different grid customizations</li>

<li>Liquid layout version</li>

<li>Compressed versions of the files to reduce load times</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='about_the_credits'>About the credits</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s important to me that people remember that this framework was not written from scratch. The whole idea and code structure, for the entire project, including the entire way of setting up the grid, is based on something I consider to be great, nay, amazing work by the following people:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jeff Croft</li>

<li>Nathan Borror</li>

<li>Christian Metts</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, the entire reset.css file was created by <a href='http://meyerweb.com/eric/'>Eric Meyer</a>, so make sure your praises are directed at the right people. :)</p>

<p>Please check out the rest of the credits at the new <a href='http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/'>BP site</a>.</p>

<h3 id='stay_tuned'>Stay tuned</h3>

<p>I have close to no control over what this project is spiraling into, so please excuse me if your mail or comments go unheard.</p>

<p>What I can promise you, is that blog posts and updates about BP will be frequent, in an effort to stagger the avalanche of support mails currently consuming my spare time.</p>

<p>(Also, the award for the coolest language to write about BP in goes to Dimox, with <a href='http://suprabiz.com/blueprint_css_framework/'>this entry</a>)</p>
