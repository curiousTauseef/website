    <p>So that&#8217;s that. Not the most impressive keynote in recent years, but a good one nonetheless. I think a lot of the people who were overly disappointed hadn&#8217;t thought about what El Jobso meant when saying he&#8217;d demo a feature complete version of Leopard. That is, that in addition to some new features, the ones we heard about six months ago would also be showcased.</p>

<p>I think Leopard looks great. It seems very polished and refined, and sets straight a lot of the inconsistencies we find in the design of Tiger (brushed metal, Finder and so forth). The new Dock also looks good, and I bet a lot of non-mac users will remark its beauty at first sight. I&#8217;m less inclined to how good it will look when configured to one of the sides though. It seems like the icons would have to fall of to remain consistent. :)</p>

<p>Quick Look is something I&#8217;ve been waiting for with a passion. I&#8217;ve always detested how hard it is to preview files, even images. Why should I have to open Preview? Quick Look seems to do just this - just tap the space bar: instant preview. Lovely!</p>

<p>Time Machine will be interesting to try out. Engadget (which I&#8217;ve never liked because of their way too contrived bashing of Apple), calls it &#8220;backup for noobs&#8221;. I think that&#8217;s a way too myopic point of view. The fact that something&#8217;s extremely user friendly doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s only for the less technically inclined. But I guess that&#8217;s what&#8217;s keeping those guys in Windows - an unbridled enthusiasm for the unnecessarily difficult. ;)</p>

<p>Safari for Windows, I&#8217;m not so sure about. Of course, bringing more people into the OS X user experience is a very good thing, but doing it by releasing a less-than-perfect imitation on Windows hardly seems to hit the spot. Many people will try Safari on Windows, and then drop the idea of a Mac all together, because they think this is what OS X feels like. It will be interesting to see how all this pans out. I might be wrong. I hope so.</p>

<p>However, the star of the show for me was not shown until after Jobs had left stage. The new <a href='http://www.apple.com/'>Apple.com</a> looks absolutely amazing. I&#8217;m even inclined to say it&#8217;s the best website out there, at least for any company trying to sell products. The product pages, and I&#8217;m not being sarcastic here, are so perfectly glossy and intuitively laid out that buying an Apple product seems like a better idea than ever before.</p>
