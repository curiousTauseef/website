<h2>The Call for Papers is now open</h2>

<p>To take place in Oslo, Norway, on September 7th-8th 2011, the conference will offer a combination of technical talks and panels in an informal atmosphere with an expected attendance over 2000. JavaZone X will be the tenth consecutive JavaZone conference. Join us and celebrate!</p>

<p>As previous years, last year's conference was a massive success, with software professionals and partners enjoying more than 100 sessions covering multiple topics, and an impressive lineup of internationally known speakers. Leading evangelists in the community rate JavaZone as one of most important Java events in Europe.</p>

<h3>Deadline?</h3>

<p>The Call for Paper closes on April 25th.</p>

<h3>Suggestion for topics</h3>

<p>We are interested in any topic that will captivate and inspire our participants, but previous conferences has typically used the following classification:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hardcore talks (see own description)
<li>Programming languages
<li>Programming concepts
<li>Concurrency & scalability
<li>Core Java
<li>Frontend
<li>Enterprise Java
<li>Testing
<li>Methodology
<li>Experience report
<li>Mobile
<li>Embedded
<li>Research
<li>Community
</ul>
<p>The abstracts should be tagged with the appropriate topics from the above list.</p>

<h3>Format and duration</h3>

<p>The presentations may be given in two formats, either a 60 minutes presentation, or a 10 minutes lightning talk.</p>

<h3>Hardcore Talks</h3>


<p>During JavaZone we have sported hardcore talks from great speakers, and these have all received great feedback, so this year we will try to solidify our concept around our bleeding red hardcore/extreme talks. We will simply call them hardcore talks.</p>

<p>One of the traits of a hardcore talk is there is not spent more than 5-7 minutes on setting the stage or introducing your topic. Assume a fair amount of knowledge in the audience.</p>

<p>To mark the talk as "Hardcore", please follow these guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Must be technical in nature
<li>Must avoid unnecessary introductory material.
<li>Should not spend more than 5 minutes on the introduction/setting.
<li>Should ideally focus on a single subject, for instance "classloaders", "debugging", "bytecode generation", "the monoid".
<li>Should be between 45 to 55 minutes (or a hardcore 10 minute lightning talk if its feasible)
<li>Remember: The deeper and more hardcore, the better.
</ul>

<h3>JourneyZone</h3>

<p>As last year we are arranging JourneyZone on the first weekend after JavaZone X, September 9th-11th. We would like to invite all speakers to explore the Norwegian nature, where we will set up a base, and enjoy the very best of Norwegian food and have a great time together. We will focus on comfort and trips/hikes for all skill levels.</p>

<blockquote>"After the conference, about 25 of us experienced a once-in-a-lifetime event of hiking in the Norwegian countryside." - Matthew McCullough</blockquote>

<p>To ensure safety and exclusivity, this journey is limited to 40 participants on a first come, first served basis. JavaZone X will subsidize the journey and bring qualified guides to ensure the best possible experience. The personal expenses will be around NOK 1500.</p>

<h3>Practical information summarized:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Transport, food, guides and accommodation are arranged and provided.
<li>The Journey will be adjusted for all hiking skill levels.
<li>Departure from Oslo Airport Gardermoen should not be booked before 8PM Sunday September 11th.
<li>Your personal expenses are estimated to NOK 1500.
<li>This will be epic - make your reservation today!
<li>Pictures from the Journey of 2010 can be found here and all over the web.
</ul>

<p>More detailed information will be provided closer to the conference. For questions and registration get in touch with us at program@java.no</p>

<h3>Monetary Policy</h3>


<p>The organizer of JavaZone is javaBin (the Norwegian Java User Group), an independent, non-profit organization. The conference has partners but no sponsors. The agenda is defined by the Program Committee without external interference. This independence is among the things that make JavaZone unique. We therefore have a limited budget for reimbursing conference speakers. Please read our money policy for more information.</p>

<h3>Contact information</h3>

<p>Please do not hesitate to contact us at program@java.no should you need any further information. Hope to see you there, and feel free to spread the word about JavaZone X in your local community.</p>

<p>Best Regards, The JavaZone Program Committee</p>
