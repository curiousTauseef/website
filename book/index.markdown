# Programmatic CSS

Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) used to be far from the realm of programming. Early versions of the CSS grammar were simple declarative rules, describing the presentation of a HTML document. Now, as the CSS spec continues to evolve, and as new languages add computational power to CSS are developed, us designers are left with a lot more options than before. 

This book is about improving CSS with techniques from programming. We will look at how this can help deal with large code bases, cross browser compatibility, semantic markup and much, much more.
