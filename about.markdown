Hi! I'm Olav Bjorkoy - a web designer and programmer from Trondheim, Norway. I'm currently studying computer science at [NTNU][5], specializing in artificial intelligence.

I once created the Blueprint CSS Framework, which is still pretty popular. In this blog, you'll find posts on CSS, HTML (especially #5), Ruby, AI, Python and everything in between.

The blog is powered by [Jekyll][1] and runs on a virtual private server provided by [Slicehost][2]. Stats are tracked with the delicious [Mint][3]. You won't find any comment forms, but contact me on [twitter][4], or send me an email: olav at bjorkoy dot com.
