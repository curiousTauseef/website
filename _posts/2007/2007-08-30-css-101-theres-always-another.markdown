So your CSS layout breaks in a certain browser (*cough* IE *cough*).

Before applying any nasty hack to fix the issue, try to use another CSS technique to achieve your desired look. 

For instance, if paddings make the layout break, try margins. If floats makes you pull your hair out, see if you can't create the same result using absolute positioning. Or just change the way the divs float. 

The point is that CSS gives you a lot of options on how to achieve your desired layout. And way too often, people spend a lot of time creating an ugly work-around before trying out every option.

There's always another way, find it before resorting to hacks.
