So that's that. Not the most impressive keynote in recent years, but a good one nonetheless. I think a lot of the people who were overly disappointed hadn't thought about what El Jobso meant when saying he'd demo a feature complete version of Leopard. That is, that in addition to some new features, the ones we heard about six months ago would also be showcased.

I think Leopard looks great. It seems very polished and refined, and sets straight a lot of the inconsistencies we find in the design of Tiger (brushed metal, Finder and so forth). The new Dock also looks good, and I bet a lot of non-mac users will remark its beauty at first sight. I'm less inclined to how good it will look when configured to one of the sides though. It seems like the icons would have to fall of to remain consistent. :)

Quick Look is something I've been waiting for with a passion. I've always detested how hard it is to preview files, even images. Why should I have to open Preview? Quick Look seems to do just this - just tap the space bar: instant preview. Lovely!

Time Machine will be interesting to try out. Engadget (which I've never liked because of their way too contrived bashing of Apple), calls it "backup for noobs". I think that's a way too myopic point of view. The fact that something's extremely user friendly doesn't mean it's only for the less technically inclined. But I guess that's what's keeping those guys in Windows - an unbridled enthusiasm for the unnecessarily difficult. ;)

Safari for Windows, I'm not so sure about. Of course, bringing more people into the OS X user experience is a very good thing, but doing it by releasing a less-than-perfect imitation on Windows hardly seems to hit the spot. Many people will try Safari on Windows, and then drop the idea of a Mac all together, because they think this is what OS X feels like. It will be interesting to see how all this pans out. I might be wrong. I hope so.

However, the star of the show for me was not shown until after Jobs had left stage. The new [Apple.com][1] looks absolutely amazing. I'm even inclined to say it's the best website out there, at least for any company trying to sell products. The product pages, and I'm not being sarcastic here, are so perfectly glossy and intuitively laid out that buying an Apple product seems like a better idea than ever before.
