The Blueprint ecosystem is growing at what seems like an exponential rate. Even I have trouble staying up to date with all the cool tools people are releasing. Most of the tools here are works in progress, so please treat them as such.

### List-o-matic

* Christian Montoya is working on a webapp called [Semantify](2). It takes the URL for a page using Blueprint as input, and lets you create semantic class names instead of using the admittedly semantically questionable BP markup. (You didn't think I was in denial of that fact, did you?) :)
* Min Kim has developed an [Adobe Air app][3] for generating customized Blueprint grid files. I've never used Air, but if that's your thing, please check it out.
* [Don Albrecht][4] is working on [The Blueprint Layout Tool][5], which is a WYSIWYG editor for creating your own grid. Impressive work in progress. He also has a cool name. The Don (yes, I had to) has also created a plugin called [SilkSprite][11], which lets you use a vast number of icons out of the box in your HTML. 
* [Alejandro Vasquez][6] has started working on a much requested [cheat sheet for Blueprint][7]. You have no idea how many people requested this.
* Here's a simple tool for [creating grid backgrounds][8] with Javascript for your desired setup, created by Jonah Fox.
* The aforementioned [Blueprint Grid Generator][9] is still going strong, complete with support for Blueprint 0.6. This tool has made my life much easier. 
* This next tool is right down my alley: A [Ruby on Rails plugin for using Blueprint][10]. Mad, raving props to Ariejan de Vroom for putting this together.

### I'm a busy man. Give me a shorter list!

We're trying to collect all the tools on [This Blueprint Wiki page][1], but I thought I'd highlight some of them. If you feel something is missing, let me know in the comments. Although that's not a prerequisite for commenting. Actual constructive comment content rarely is.

Finally, here's [the article][12] which should complement what you've just read through.

Now, back to reading frantically on all the courses I'll fail either way. Damn you Blueprint! Maybe I should intimidate my professors by changing my name to Don.. I'll get back to you on that.
