I've been laughing at [Twitter][1] for a long time now, laughing because I honestly couldn't see the point. We already seem to have so many ways of staying in touch over the net, that continuously swapping posts under 140 characters about "what are you doing?" simply seems like too much. But that was then.

I am now smitten. With the help of [Twitterific][2], a marvelous tool for reading and posting twits, Twitter is now an integral part of my daily procrastination. It's true what [Kottke][3] says when he compares Twitter to what blogging once was - it's about the people, not the technology or how to get (hits|money|zealots).

Twitter may seem like a great waste of time, and it is just that. It's great, and it's a waste of time. It's great because you're learning something new about friends, maybe about friends you've only met through a blog, a friend that is a friend because of your matching views on  the W3C or whatnot. It's a waste of time because it's addictive.

Now you friendships can mean more, because the friend behind the blog is suddenly visible, through his or hers daily routines, boring as they may be. So thanks, Twitter. I hope you'll stay just the way you are.

So go ahead, [add me][4]! :)
