First, take a look at [this video][1].

Now, if Adobes new suit of web development apps work as well as this video proclaims, consider me stunned. Just look at how the different apps come together in the presented workflow: Designing core assets in Illustrator and Photoshop, mocking it up in Fireworks, and importing it all into Dreamweaver for the HTML.

Of course, the video is advertising, and I, as most people, know not to touch anything that claims to deliver perfect WYSIWYG web development with a fairly long pole. However, the direction in which the industry seems to be heading, and how far it seems to have come, has really made me have to think this statement through.

However, the best slice of this upgrade seems to be Fireworks. This long neglected designers tool, always in the shadow of the colossus that is PhotoShop, really seems to be coming into its own, with it being a tool to mock up web designs, while PS sticks to photography.

(Which is as it should be; I've always considered Fireworks far superior to PS in terms of web design development, despite the fact that most designers clings to the latter).
