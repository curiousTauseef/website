title: Perspectives gained from switching CMS and redesigning the blog

[SimpleLog][1] claims to be too simple for most people, yet, after a few days using it, I don't think it lacks anything. Posts, pages, tags, comments and Markdown is really all you need.

[Markdown][2] is a great way to mark up text when you're writing to a blog. It's weird, but the whole process of actually writing this into a textarea is much more enjoyable now that the markup looks good even at this point. I don't think I'll ever go back to anything else.

I still can't decide wether I want links embedded in the main stream of recent entries or not. I'd need some sort of bookmarklet like the one you get from [Del.icio.us][3] to post links quickly, if this is to happen. I could perhaps find a way to import Del.icio.us links as they get posted, but that seems a bit tricky.

I keep coming back to the issue of who I should write for. Do I want as many readers as possible, or do I simply want an outlet for whatever I feel like imposing on the world? As always, it's going to be a bit of both.

Above it all though, I'm wondering if people will get the new title.
