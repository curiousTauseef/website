You might have personal problems if the return of my blog is as important to you as it is to me, but let's assume for the purpose of justifying this entry that it is. 

The blog returns after a short hiatus, imposed by MediaTemple's rails hosting, which I hear is based on a wobbly cluster of jello-cored Elbonian brand servers. It looks different, yes, but this is the good kind of different. Here's why:

* It doesn't have a design I'll instantly tire of (or so I hope).
* It's faster to serve, easier to customize and has better spam protection (fear my untested rails skills).
* It's inspired by a recent favorite blog of mine, [Dive into Mark][1]. (Naturally, mimicking the design of a good writer means my writing will improve as a result).
* The text is Helvetica, big and friendly, as it should be. Why do we ever use 11/12px sized text anyway?
* It has better archives, tag support, comment form, et cetera.

However, when I say it's "better", I mostly mean "better for me". You might disagree. Bjorkoy's law, however, categorically refutes whatever argument you might have:

> **Bjorkoy's law:** "The quality of written content improves linearly with the level of satisfaction the writer derives from the environment in which the content is written."

Never mind the fact that I just made this axiom up. I also made up an axiom that says that axioms easily can be made up on the spot. Also, one that circular reasoning is perfectly valid logic. 

The point is, when I like my blog, my writing improves, which you of course enjoy as well. Happy new year, have a good one. I predict another year of "too many tables", `<!--[if lt IE 7]>` and questionable redesigns. Welcome back! :)
